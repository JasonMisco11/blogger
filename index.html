                <p>"Should you start a blog? One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. z<br> Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things,
                    so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style. <br> And because of the format, many successful bloggers will write about a variety of topics on the same blog. <br> In addition, you donâ€™t need to be an expert on
                    any of the xbout their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.
